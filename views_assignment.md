# Django Class-Based Views Assignment

## Prerequisites
* Update your fork with the latest commit from the master branch of crcresearch/codecamp-skillinator-django
* Make a branch for the views assignment in your forked repo
* Migrate the database (or delete the old one and start fresh)
* Superuser should be defined in the database already
* Install fixtures (on windows use windows-style slashes in the first one)
    <code>python manage.py loaddata fixtures/auth_initial_data.json</code>
    <code>python manage.py loaddata --app skillsmatrix initial_data.json</code>
* At this point, the server should run, but going to any page will throw an error.

## Assignment Details
TODO, but will update directly on github...
